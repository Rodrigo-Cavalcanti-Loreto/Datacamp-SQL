--Now, use GROUPING SETS to get the same result, i.e. the average rating over country and gender.



SELECT 
	c.country, 
    c.gender,
	AVG(r.rating)
FROM renting AS r
LEFT JOIN customers AS c
ON r.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((country, gender)); -- Group by country and gender with GROUPING SETS
