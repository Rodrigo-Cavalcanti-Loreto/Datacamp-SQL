-- Exclude NULL values in metroarea_pop.
-- Order by city_perc (descending) and return only the first 10 rows.
-- Select fields from cities
SELECT cities.name , cities.country_code, city_proper_pop, metroarea_pop, (cities.city_proper_pop / metroarea_pop * 100) AS city_perc

-- Add filter condition such that metroarea_pop does not have null values
    AND metroarea_pop IS NOT NULL
-- Sort and limit the result
