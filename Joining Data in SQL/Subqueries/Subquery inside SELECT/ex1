-- Write a LEFT JOIN with countries on the left and the cities on the right, joining on country code.
-- In the SELECT statement of your join, include country names as country, and count the cities in each country, aliased as cities_num.
-- Sort by cities_num (descending), and country (ascending), limiting to the first nine records.
-- Find top nine countries with the most cities
