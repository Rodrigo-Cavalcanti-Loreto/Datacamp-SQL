-- Select the country_code from p1 and the size field from both p1 and p2, aliasing p1.size as size2010 and p2.size as size2015 (in that order).
-- Select aliased fields from populations as p1
SELECT p1.country_code, p1.size AS size2010, p2.size AS size2015
FROM populations AS p1
-- Join populations as p1 to itself, alias as p2, on country code
INNER JOIN populations AS p2
