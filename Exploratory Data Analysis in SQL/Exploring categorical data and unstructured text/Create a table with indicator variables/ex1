--Create a temp table indicators from evanston311 with three columns: id, email, and phone.
--Use LIKE comparisons to detect the email and phone patterns that are in the description, and cast the result as an integer with CAST().
--Your phone indicator should use a combination of underscores _ and dashes - to represent a standard 10-digit phone number format.
--Remember to start and end your patterns with % so that you can locate the pattern within other text!

-- To clear table if it already exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS indicators;

-- Create the indicators temp table
CREATE TEMP TABLE indicators AS
  -- Select id
SELECT id, 
         -- Create the email indicator (find @)
